# TestforCheatAPImod
This is a test mod to showcase how to use my various APIs for any developers looking to develop with them. 
Look at the different files for different APIs
If other developers what to add their own examples, or their own API's, I will accept pull requests. 
However, only add new API's if you are the developer of them.
